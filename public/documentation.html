  <h1>Achievement 2 Project: myFlix</h1>
  <p>To build the server-side component of a "movies" web application. The web application will provide users with access to information about different movies, directors, and genres. Users will be able to sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.</p>
  <p>Users can view my top 10 favorite movies, request data about a single movie by title, or about a single genre, or director.</p>
  <p>Users may also register their names and are assigned a unique ID number, using npm uuid.</p>
  <p>Existing users may update their user names, add or remove their favorite movies, or deregister</p>
