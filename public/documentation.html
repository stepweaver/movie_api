  <h1>Achievement 2 Project: myFlix</h1>
  <p>To build the server-side component of a "movies" web application. The web application will provide users with access to information about different movies, directors, and genres. Users will be able to sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.</p>
  <p>In the POST request above, the newStudent object is formatted in a specific way (it includes the student name, their
  classes, and the grades in those classes). While you know this specific format because you created the database and the
  API, clients wishing to use your API wouldn't automatically know the correct format they need to write their objects in.
  This type of information would need to be included in the documentation of your API. Without it, clients would have a
  pretty tough time getting their apps to work!</p>
